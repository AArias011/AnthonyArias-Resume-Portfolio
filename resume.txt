Extracurricular Activities:
=================================================================
For extracurricular activities I went to a catholic church called Saint John Vianney, I went there for three years for my confirmation and first communion. Me going there required for me to go to these events every tuesday, they called it Teen club. In the club we learned about leadership, social skills and it just gave us a chance to socialize with other people. We would have ice breaking activities to help us get to know each other and most importantly we learned about God and what he has done for us. The program was really fun and It really showed me a lot, I got to meet new people and I got to make new friends.
